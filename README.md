Welcome to Auto Care Vehicle Services, your go-to web application for seamless vehicle service bookings and management.

This innovative web app not only streamlines the booking process but also emphasizes security by addressing the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. With OIDC protocols implemented via the cloud-based Identity Provider (IDP) Asgardeo, robust user authentication and access control are ensured. The application employs various techniques to enhance security, protecting against Broken Access Control, Injection Vulnerabilities, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) threats. Dive into this repository to discover strategies for securing web applications and to deepen your knowledge of web security best practices.
